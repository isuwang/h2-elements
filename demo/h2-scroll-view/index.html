          <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
              on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
              peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
              pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,'
              thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
          <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
              for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
              the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
              of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
              Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
          <p>There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did
              Alice think it so <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the
              Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when
              she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought
              to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
              natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its
                  waistcoat-pocket,</i> and looked at it, and then hurried on,
              Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
              she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
              waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
              curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
              just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
              hedge.</p>
          <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
              considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
